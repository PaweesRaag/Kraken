# **The Self-Rewriting Beast**

Imagine a program that literally **rewrites its own brain** while it’s still running.  
Every tick of the clock, it rearranges its own code like a mischievous sorcerer flipping through a cursed spellbook.

You stand before **fifteen cryptic buttons** — each one a trap and a clue.  
Every press doesn’t just do one thing… it twists and tangles three secret variables — `a`, `b`, and `c` — like a **Rubik’s Cube from hell**.  
The puzzle isn’t *what* they do — it’s *how* they change when the rules keep shifting.

At the start, the program is generous enough to give you **two keys**: `7` and `9`.  
The other **eight keys**? They’re hidden somewhere deep inside a jungle of **XORs**, **ANDs**,  
and **divide-by-zero landmines** just waiting for you to make a single wrong move.

Press the right sequence and the binary will **bow to you in quiet submission**.  
Press the wrong one, and it will hit you with a smug, almost human *"An error occurred"* —  
mocking you before wiping away your progress.

This is not a normal puzzle.  
This is **you vs. the clock**, **you vs. the code**, and **you vs. a binary that thinks it’s clever**.  
But here’s the thing:  
it’s just a program.  
It doesn’t know you’ve been waiting for something like this.

Let’s show it who’s really running the code.
