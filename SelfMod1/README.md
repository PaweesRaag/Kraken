# Picture this:  
A program that literally rewrites its own brain while running.  
Fifteen cryptic button presses, each twisting three secret variables — `a`, `b`, and `c` — like a Rubik’s Cube from hell.  
You’ve got two keys to start: `7` and `9`. The other eight? Hidden in a jungle of XORs, ANDs, and divides-by-zero just waiting to ruin your day.  
Get the combo right, and the program bows to you. Get it wrong, and it hits you with a smug *"An error occurred"*.  
It’s you, the clock, and a binary that thinks it’s clever.  
Let’s show it who’s really running the code.
